CRITICAL POST-INSTALLATION STEP:

After installation completes, you MUST create backup shares immediately!

The installer will guide you through this process. The service uses Shamir 
Secret Sharing to protect your cryptographic keys. Without backup shares, 
you will NOT be able to recover your keys if the system fails.

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

SECURITY NOTES:

  • The service generates a unique Ed25519 keypair on first run
  • The private key is encrypted with Windows DPAPI
  • The private key NEVER leaves the service
  • Backup shares allow key recovery on a different machine
  • Each share is useless by itself - you need the threshold number
